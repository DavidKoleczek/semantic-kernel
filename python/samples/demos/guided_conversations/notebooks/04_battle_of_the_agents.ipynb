    "# A Battle of the Agents - Simulating Conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "A key challenge with building agents is testing them. Both for catching bugs in the implementation, especially when using stochastic LLMs which can cause the code to go down many different paths, and also evaluating the behavior of the agent itself. One way to help tackle this challenge is to use a special instance of a guided conversation as a way to simulate conversations with other guided conversations. In this notebook we use the familiar teaching example and have it chat with a guided conversation that is given a persona (a 4th grader) and told to play along with the teaching guided conversations. We will refer to this guided conversation as the \"simulation\" agent. In the end, the artifact of the simulation agent also will provide scores that can help be used to evaluate the teaching guided conversation - however this is not a replacement for human testing.\n"

An acrostic poem is a fun type of writing where you choose a word or phrase and use each letter to start a line of poetry. The first thing you do is write your chosen word or phrase down the page vertically. Then next to each letter, you write a word, phrase, or sentence that begins with that letter and is related to your chosen word or phrase. To give you an example, if the word is 'HAPPY,' the poem might look like this:\n",

You've used the letters of her name to start each line, and those lines show a lot about her character and the joy she brings you. It's clear you care a lot about her. Here’s a little feedback for you: Try to think about how you can use vivid images or actions in your poem so someone reading it can picture her more clearly. For example, instead of 'Always happy, never sad,' you might describe something specific she does that shows her happiness. Want to give it another go? Remember, with poetry, specific details can really bring your words to life!\n",

Using specific actions like 'Bouncing around the yard' and 'Leaping high to catch frisbees' really helps others see what she's like. Well done enhancing the imagery! As a poet, you're also helping readers connect emotionally with the subject of your poem, which is BELLA, in this case.

There's always more to learn and ways to make your poetry even richer. Poets often revise their work many times to make it just right.

Changing even a single word can have a big impact! Also, there are many different types of poems you could try writing. Have you heard about haiku or limericks? Both are fun and have their own unique rules. A haiku is a three-line poem with a 5-7-5 syllable count, and a limerick is a humorous five-line poem with a specific rhythm and rhyme pattern. Would you be interested in learning more about these or any other types of poetry?\n",

They're a lot of fun and each type of poetry can teach us something different about language and expression. Poetry is all about playing with words and sounds, and I'm sure you'll enjoy experimenting with it. Before we finish up today, is there anything else you'd like to ask about acrostic poems or any thoughts you'd like to share? I'm here to help, and it's been great discussing poetry with you!\n",
